# Tracts 3 populations model for the MXL data

I have fitted a seris of Tracts models for the MXL data:
- [ppx_xxp](../210531-TRACTS-ppx_xxp) -> First EUR and NAT arrive followed by a pulse from ARF.
- [ppx_xxp_pxx](../210616-TRACTS-ppx_xxp_pxx) -> First EUR and NAT arrive followed by a pulse from ARF and then a subsequence EUR pulse.
- [ccx_xxp](../210619-TRACTS-ccx_xxp) -> EUR and NAT arrive continuously at each generation followed by a single pulse of AFR.
- [ppx_ccx_xxp](../210619-TRACTS-ccx_xxp/ppx_ccx_xxp) -> This model is very similar to ccx_xxp excep that the migrants fractions for the very first generation are differet from the continuous pulse. We did this because we have observed that likely the first generations were composed mainly of NAT ancestry.

Here, I collect the results from the models to generate a visualization.
