#  Analyzing the distribution of variants: Synonymous vs Non-Synonymous


## Overview

I will look at the SFS distribution for the variants in the following categories: 
- Synonymous variant
- Non-synonymous variant:
    - In-frame insertion
    - In-frame deletion
    - Missense variantlll

For each of these, I will look at the SFS distribution, for each populations. This is similar to the
`[previous sfs analysis](../210404-AncestralAlleleSFS).
