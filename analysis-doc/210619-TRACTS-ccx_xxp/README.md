# Model ccp_xxp

Here, I fit the ccxp_xxp model. In addition, I also create a new model: ppx_ccp_xxp where the only difference
is that the arriving migrants proportions (in the first generation) are different than the proportions in the
continuous arrivals. This model is [here](ppx_ccx_xxp/ccx_xxp.py). I kept the same names.
