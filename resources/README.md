# Additional data to run analysis

This folder is meant to contain all resources necessary for running the workflow, for example reference sequences or databases.
Wherever feasible, they can also be downloaded programmatically via rules defined in the pipeline.


## Data sets

+ **genetic-maps/ |** Genetic maps. See `../workflow/rules/accesory-data.smk`
+ **1TGP-samples-meta-data/igsr-1000genomes.tsv |** This file contains sample information from the 1TGP high coverage data. I renamed this file (original: igsr-1000\ genomes\ 30x\ on\ grch38.tsv.tss). This file was obtained from [here](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/30x-grch38).
