Input data:
        
The following maps are formatted [B, length], 
after McVicker et al., 2009, where B is the 
B value (scaled from 0-1000) covering a given 
chromosome segment and length is the length 
of the segment in base pairs. Segments sum to
the length of each chromosome in the hg19 
build.

For example, the row:
 
	717 29307

assigns a B value of 0.717 (after rescaling)
to a segment of 29307 base pairs.

The output is a bed file with the following

chromosome, start, end, B value

usage:
    python bmaps-to-bed.py <infile> <outfile>

args:
    infile: bmap file
    outfile: bed file
