## Demographic inference

Demographic inference from SFS.


This directory is organized:
 
    - demes
    - models

## Package requirements

We'll be using a few standard packages for scientific computing, plotting, and simulation. We also use packages for
demographic analysis including [moments](https://moments.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [demes](https://popsim-consortium.github.io/demes-docs/main/introduction.html), [msprime](https://tskit.dev/msprime/docs/latest/intro.html).


```
conda env create --file env.yaml
conda activate demography
```
