## Overview

The goal of this analysis is to Inhere the model in regions of the genome with
different levels of background selection as measure by the B-scores.

This is to replay to this reviewer's comments:

```
Reviewer 2:
Regarding the EAS-AME branching time in Figure 2, it is curious that synonymous
sites are most inflated compared to expectation, followed by intronic, and
finally intergenic. I would be very curious if the intergenic SNPs were subset
even further to pull out just those that are the least exposed to background
selection (e.g. from McVicker et al B statistic). It is known that background
selection can drive higher Fst values near the deleterious loci over short
periods, and may be contributing to this inflation. It is also possible (as I
suggested above) that CHB is not the best EAS sample to use, and that other
samples may do a better job of identifying a more recent EAS-AME branching
time.
